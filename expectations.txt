As the course title suggests, (CMSC 100 - Web Programming), 
I am expecting this course to challenge our critical thinking skills 
while honing our creativity all at the same time. I am looking forward to learn various 
web development techniques for the whole semester under this course.

Yanika Tauro (partner):
I agree with his expectations! I hope to have fun and learn a lot from this course along with everyone!
